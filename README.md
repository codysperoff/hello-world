Hello GitHubbers!

I just graduated from Augustana College. Trying out coding to see if I like it and want to pursue a career in it. Not really sure what I want to do as a career, and this sounded pretty interesting. My brother suggested I make a GitHub account so I can upload all of my work. Hope to soak up some knowledge!
